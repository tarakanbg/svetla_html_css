      The Ancient Egyptian Goddess Bastet
    </h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Bastet</strong> was originally a fierce lioness warrior goddess of
      the sun worshiped throughout most of ancient Egyptian history, but later
      she was changed into the cat goddess that is familiar today. She then was
      depicted as the daughter of Ra and Isis, and the consort of Ptah, with
      whom she had a son Maahes. As protector of Lower Egypt, she was seen as
      defender of the king, and consequently of the sun god, Ra. Along with
      other deities such as Hathor, Sekhmet, and Isis, Bastet was associated
      with the <em>Eye of Ra</em>.

    <p>
      <strong>Bastet</strong> is also a goddess of the home, domesticity,
      fertility, and childbirth. She protected the house from evil spirits and
      disease, especially diseases associated with women and children. As with
      many deities in Egyptian religion, she also played a role in the afterlife
      as a guide and helper to the dead although this was not one of her primary
      duties.

    <h2>Iconography</h2>

    <p>
      From her earliest attestations until the later New Kingdom,
      <strong>Bastet</strong> is exclusively shown as a lioness. Her iconography
      borrowed from the earlier goddess Mafdet and also from Hathor, a goddess
      associated with Sekhmet who was also closely linked to
      <strong>Bastet</strong>. The appearance of the sistrum in Bastet's hand in
      some statues is a clear link to Hathor who is traditionally seen carrying
      the instrument. Her famed symbolization as a cat is a later development.
      The double nature of <strong>Bastet</strong> as lioness and cat is often
      expressed by her conflation with <strong>Sekhmet</strong>, another famous
      lioness goddess.This ambivalent character of feline goddesses and
      especially Bastet developed further in subsequent periods. A cat
      symbolized the gentler, more accessible, more attractive nature of a
      feline goddess. This re-imagination of Bastet as a kinder form of lioness
      evidently led to her depiction as a cat, which did not pose the same
      threat to people as a real lioness.

    <h2>Place of Worship</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Bastet</strong> was a local deity whose religious sect was
      centered in the city that became named, <em>Bubastis</em>. It lay in the
      Nile Delta near what is known today as Zagazig. The town, known in
      Egyptian as <em>Per-Bastet</em>, carries her name, literally meaning
      <strong>House of Bastet</strong>. It was known in Greek as
      <em>Boubastis</em>. In the biblical Book of Ezekiel 30:17, the town
      appears in the Hebrew form <em>Pibeseth</em>. Herodotus describes the
      temple dedicated to the goddess in details. At the Bubastis temple, some
      cats were found to have been mummified and buried, many next to their
      owners. More than 300 000 mummified cats were discovered when Bastet's
      temple was excavated. Extensive burials of cat remains were found not only
      at Bubastis, but also at Beni Hasan and Saqqara, the last significant
      discoveries dating from 2019.
